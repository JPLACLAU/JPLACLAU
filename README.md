### Hi there 👋

I am ✨Jean-Paul Laclau✨, a guy from Buenos Aires learning to code.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my Web3 portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and ReactJS. I am also enrolled in a MSc. in Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies at University of Nicosia.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Smart Contracts
- 🌎 I speak fluent French, Spanish & English. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been a Marine Biologist with a Master's in Sustainability for a decade and got tired of it. 
- 🖥️ I am looking for job stability and to be able to work remotely by writing code, which I recently discovered makes me very happy. 

You can learn more about me and how to contact me on my portfolio website, https://code.jplaclau.com/
